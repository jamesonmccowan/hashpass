HashPass Firefox Add-on

This add-on adds a new menu item to the right-click menu when you right-click on a password field.
By selecting this new item, "Generate Password Hash", a dialog menu pops up that takes the domain 
and password and generates a hash to be used as a password for that site.

This was made in an attempt to learn how to make a Firefox add-on. If you're looking for why one
would bother hashing thier password, see this other add-on's description:

Hopefully I'll find some time to add a few more features I have in mind, and refine this readme.
